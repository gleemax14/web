# Port Forwarding Guide for Donut Haven Website

## Quick Solution for Remote Access

1. **Continue using your express_server.js**
   - This server is already working well on your local network (192.168.100.2:8080)

2. **Set up Port Forwarding on your Router**
   - Open your web browser and enter: 192.168.100.1 (or 192.168.1.1)
   - Login to your router (check router label for default credentials)
   - Find "Port Forwarding" section (might be under "Advanced Settings")
   - Create a new rule with these settings:
     * Protocol: TCP/UDP or Both
     * External Port: 8080 (or 80 if you want standard HTTP)
     * Internal IP: 192.168.100.2 (your computer's IP)
     * Internal Port: 8080
     * Enable/Save the rule

3. **Find your Public IP Address**
   - Visit https://whatismyip.com or simply Google "what is my ip"
   - Your public IP will look like: 203.0.113.X

4. **Share your website**
   - Anyone on the internet can now access your site at: http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:8080
   - Example: http://203.0.113.25:8080

## Important Notes

- **Dynamic IP Issue:** Most home internet connections have dynamic IPs that change periodically. Consider using a Dynamic DNS service like no-ip.com to get a permanent domain name.

- **Firewall Settings:** Make sure Windows Firewall allows incoming connections on port 8080:
  1. Open Windows Defender Firewall (search in Start menu)
  2. Click "Advanced settings"
  3. Select "Inbound Rules" → "New Rule"
  4. Choose "Port" → "TCP" → "Specific local ports: 8080" → Allow connection → Apply to all profiles → Name it "Donut Haven Server"

- **Security Considerations:**
  - Opening ports increases security exposure
  - Consider using a VPN for private access instead
  - Only keep the port open when needed
